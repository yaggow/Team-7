Having all the schedules of different courses in different sites, pages and applications can result in a disorganized schedule, which is not helpful for the important task that is time management for students. The group decided for this project after balanced which project shows more interest in execution, also we choose a project that deals with a problem that the members of the groups believe is crucial to enhance the academic performance of university students, promoting a substantial benefit to students’ live.

MVP

The message software should allow students, Professors, TAs an administration staff to communicate with other members of the university in a more global and easier manner. By dividing the message between groups, people can post related to specific themes, with the guarantee that the users who are interested in the topic will have access to the information. 
Also, the system will allow user to post messages to existing topics as well. Posting messages to existing topics allow user to trade important information, interact with each other and guarantee that people who access the topic in the future will have their questions answered regarding to the theme of the topic. 
Also, we want to allow a smart tool for administration of the topics, which will guarantee that nothing that is offensive or against the law will be on the topics and that the users who broke the rules will be excluded for the system. This way we can guarantee that there will be no problems with the law in the system, and there will be no lawsuits against the providers of the system.
	
Release and Iteration Planning

For the first release, the user stories 1,2,3,4 and 5 will be implemented. These user stories are the base of the project, because of that the implementation of them mean that we will the minimum structure for the product.
	The user stories with Priority 3 (P3) and difficulty 3 (D3) are excluded from the first release. Since the user stories with Priority 3 (P3) are not vital to the well work of the software, they are not necessary to the first release. User stories with difficulty 3 (D3) were defined to not contain vital implementation to the system, since they require a long time to be implemented properly.
	For the fist week of iteration, the user stories 1,2,3 should be implemented. Since these user stories do not contain high difficulty and are have a connected implementation, the team should not have problem to implement them in one week.
